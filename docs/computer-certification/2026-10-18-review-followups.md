| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A1     | Capture the geometry epoch after the admitted action invalidates prior observations, immediately before dispatch. Subsequent invalidations still reject that capture. The HTTP integration covers screenshot → click → click without another screenshot.                                                                                                                             |
| A2     | Both adapters classify the actual notification's `sessionUpdate` before mapping events, independently of native logging. Tests exercise unseen update-only calls with logging disabled in Cursor, Grok and the shared Antigravity adapter.                                                                                                                                           |
| A3     | Classified calls bypass both Grok and Antigravity task extraction. The adapter tests assert that private task output produces neither task events nor persisted content.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| A4     | Turn completion records the ended turn and cancels an unpinned startup waiter. The regression holds initial context resolution, ends the turn and verifies immediate interruption and rejection after resolution.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| B1     | Added frozen per-harness preview verification flags, all false. Production sessions install no preview catalog until verification. The live startup/inventory suite uses an injected test override and never changes production flags.                                                                                                                                               |
| B2     | Runtime, authentication and spawn errors retain bounded, scrubbed messages. Only new/load/resume setup failures receive fixed codes. A weak, in-memory record preserves error origin across startup/fallback handling without changing internal retry classification. Raw causes are omitted.                                                                                        |
| B3     | The preparer already checked provenance, but an incoming `computerTool` flag could survive that check. It now strips incoming flags. Ingestion accepts only authenticated provenance or private admission evidence, carried across the server's in-memory queue. A third-party `computer_click` with a forged flag stays generic, including after queue admission.                   |
| B4     | Successful Stop clears its flag when no held lease or pending takeover remains. Failures and held leases still require authoritative release. Added the no-lease regression.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| B5     | Reproduced all ten previously unclassified failures on untouched `main` under a clean environment; see the baseline comparison below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| B6     | Removed full log-redaction passes from event publishing. Classification runs only on tool events in computer-capable sessions and on permission events. Native loggers own one redaction pass per sink; the runtime delegates to those writers rather than redacting again.                                                                                                          |
| B7     | Protocol errors retain numeric codes, human text beginning with brackets stays readable, and failed request logs use a `failure` field rather than `result`. Setup details and raw error data remain bounded to prevent echoed configuration from leaking.                                                                                                                           |
| B8     | Known native calls keep their classification on partial updates with no input, unless the update introduces suspicious tool identity or kind. Unseen update-only calls remain computer-classified, and computer IDs never revert.                                                                                                                                                    |
| B9     | Tool history receives delivery from its own dispatch callback. Concurrent calls cannot share a last-delivery value; a plain wait has no delivery badge. A concurrent completion regression covers the ordering.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| B10    | Aggregate wait start/completion preserves the last capture. Idle turn completion preserves observations; completion that cancels admitted work still invalidates it. Pause, revocation, capture failure and session disposal retain their invalidation behavior.                                                                                                                     |
| B11    | Discovery records bounded stderr and gives temporary scratch writes a separate location, excluded from persistent registration drift. The repeated probe identifies the sandbox failure and confirms unchanged operator registrations.                                                                                                                                               |
| B12    | Both verification records are frozen. Live tests inject overrides through constructor options, which production drivers leave unset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| B13    | Catalog callback exceptions become typed ACP failures with a fixed code. A regression verifies the failure is not an Effect defect and contains no thrown marker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| B14    | Codex receives a Codex-specific Chrome gate message. Settings uses provider display labels, derives native fallback text from live session reports and caches configuration lookup by activity-array identity. Muse's explicit configuration event is retained: it supplies the required unsupported reason, and there is no other explicit configuration publisher in that adapter. |

The prompt-redaction safeguard is also retained in computer-capable ACP sessions. The
live privacy requirement excludes the typed marker from **all** native logs; a prompt
that instructs the agent to type that marker would otherwise expose it before any tool
call. Ordinary ACP sessions do not receive that prompt redaction.

## Live probes and closed gates

The Cursor [control](2026-10-18-acp-preview-review-control.json) and
[preview-only](2026-10-18-acp-preview-review-preview.json) runs both initialized and
then hit the 25-second startup timeout during authentication, before `session/new`
sent MCP configuration. Neither produced session events or passing inventory evidence.
This locates the observed startup blocker before the catalog payload is sent; it does
not establish live preview compatibility. Preview and computer verification flags
therefore remain false for all three ACP harnesses.

The repeated [Chrome discovery](2026-10-18-claude-chrome-native-host-review.json)
records `sandbox-exec: sandbox_apply: Operation not permitted`, exit 71, no temporary
writes or registrations, and identical operator manifests. A candidate descriptor,
real Chrome certification driver, signed-build certification, complete ACP conformance,
manual desktop checks and native timing evidence remain outstanding. None can be
claimed from these probes.

## Baseline comparison

A detached baseline worktree was created at `/tmp/f5-review-baseline-f8fd15` from local
`main`, commit `f8fd15a7700f9e925c720a68ed03828d5061a014` (also the implementation base).
Dependencies were installed with `bun install --frozen-lockfile`. Test commands used
`env -i HOME="$HOME" PATH="$PATH"` in both worktrees.

- `bun run --cwd apps/server test:file src/distribution/launcher.test.ts src/wsServer.test.ts`:
  **129 passed, 5 failed** on baseline. The same three launcher failures and two Agent
  Bridge credential-file failures reproduce without this implementation.
- `bun run --cwd apps/server test:file integration/orchestrationEngine.integration.test.ts`:
  **1 passed, 5 failed, 1 skipped** on baseline. Each failed turn is rejected before
  execution because its recorded worktree does not match its repository and branch.
- `bun run --cwd scripts test upstream-port-migration.test.ts`: **13 passed, 2 failed**
  on baseline, reproducing both migration recovery failures.

Local baseline logs are `/tmp/f5-review-baseline-unit.log`,
`/tmp/f5-review-baseline-integration.log` and `/tmp/f5-review-baseline-migration.log`.

## Verification

- Focused server/adapters/catalog/cleanup run: **129 passed**. The final delivery,
  observation-preservation and logging regressions then passed **75 tests** across
  their five files.
- Provider service and runtime ingestion suites: **220 passed**.
- Web store and controls: **21 passed**.
- Exhaustive real-Git matrix: **140 passed** across all four files, run separately.
- `bun run test:full` ran and stopped at the two known migration recovery failures,
  before its Git stage. The separate exhaustive run above completed that stage.

- Final `bun fmt`, `bun lint` and `bun typecheck`: **passed**; lint reports 28 warnings
  and zero errors, and typecheck completed all eight packages.
- Chromium live-card and control coverage: **13 passed**.
- Continuing workspace run (`bun run test --continue`): server units **4,418 passed,
  5 failed, 10 skipped**; the five failures are the baseline launcher/Agent Bridge
  failures above. All other workspace packages passed except scripts, which has the
  same **301 passed, 2 migration failures**. The server unit failure prevents its
  chained integration stage, so integration was run separately.
- Separate integration suite: **18 passed, 5 failed, 18 skipped**; all five failures
  match the baseline orchestration worktree invariant failures. Both new preview-live
  cases are skipped unless explicitly enabled.
- `git diff --check`: passed.

The initial full typecheck found a new test fixture missing `frontmost` and an Effect
Schema `instanceof` diagnostic. Both were corrected; the final full typecheck passed.
Local final logs use `/tmp/f5-review-`: `typecheck-pass.log`, `lint-final.log`,
`workspace.log`, `integration-final.log`, `git-extended.log`, `browser.log`,
`focused-final.log` and `last-regressions.log`.
